# MyReads Project

A bookshelf where you can search for the desired theme and add them to one of the 3 personal shelves: I would like to read, read and read today.
If you enter a page that does not exist, a 404 page is displayed.

## Important
The backend API uses a fixed set of cached search results and is limited to a particular set of search terms, which can be found in [SEARCH_TERMS.md](SEARCH_TERMS.md). That list of terms are the _only_ terms that will work with the backend, so don't be surprised if your searches for Basket Weaving or Bubble Wrap don't come back with any results.
